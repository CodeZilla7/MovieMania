# MovieMania
This project interacts with The Movie DB API to show movies and their trailers. It's also part of my
exercise to master Kotlin and the Android Architecture Components libraries.

# Libraries used
1. Room Database
2. Navigation

# Stability
The app does not focus so much on stability hence I am using the AndroidX libraries that were
released at Google I/O 2018. My main focus here is to show how you can use the new features while
they are still in developmental stages so that you can know how to use it in production when they
are in stable.
